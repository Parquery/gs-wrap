gs-wrap
=======

Python3 wrapper for gsutil commands

Usage
=====
.. code-block:: python

    import gs_wrap

Installation
============


* Create a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv venv3


* Activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

    source venv3/bin/activate


* Install gs-wrap with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install gs-wrap


Development
===========

* Check out the repository.

* In the repository root, create the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv venv3

* Activate the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    source venv3/bin/activate

* Install the development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -e .[dev]

We use tox for testing and packaging the distribution. Assuming that the above-mentioned environment variables has been set, the virutal environment has been activated and the development dependencies have been installed, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox


Pre-commit Checks
-----------------

We provide a set of pre-commit checks that lint and check code for formatting.

Namely, we use:

* `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ to check the formatting.
* The style of the docstrings is checked with `pydocstyle <https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle>`_.
* Static type analysis is performed with `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_.
* Various linter checks are done with `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_.
* Doctests are executed using the Python `doctest module <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/doctest.html>`_.

Run the pre-commit checks locally from an activated virtual environment with development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./precommit.py

* The pre-commit script can also automatically format the code:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./precommit.py  --overwrite


Versioning
==========
We follow `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html>`_. The version X.Y.Z indicates:

* X is the major version (backward-incompatible),
* Y is the minor version (backward-compatible), and
* Z is the patch version (backward-compatible bug fix).
